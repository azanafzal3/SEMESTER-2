## 📊 Final Project – Hospital Management System

A menu-driven console application in C++ that allows:
- Adding/removing patients
- Searching records by ID or name
- Saving and loading records using file handling
- Demonstrates inheritance, operator overloading, and file I/O

## 🚀 How to Compile & Run

### ▶️ Compile a C++ file
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
▶️ Run the compiled program
bash
Copy
Edit
./output
Replace filename.cpp with your source file name and output with the executable name.
```
